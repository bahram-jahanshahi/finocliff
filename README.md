The goal of this project is to learn how to analyse the market — both fundamentally and technically.

When you look at a platform like **OpenBB**, you are presented with countless APIs that return and overwhelming ocean of numbers. But what do these numbers really mean? Why are they important? And how can they help us understand the market?

This where LLMs come in. AI can help interpret these numbers, explain their significance, and provide insights into whether a stock is worth investing in.

For me, this project is a hands-on way to dive into financial data: to learn the key numbers, metrics, and techniques used in fundamental and technical analysis— while also leveraging AI to deepen and accelerate that learning.

**Action:** If I had money to invest, this project should enable me to identify the right opportunities.
